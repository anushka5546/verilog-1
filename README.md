**Digital design projects and testbenches in Verilog — from basic gates to custom multipliers.**

---

## 📂 What’s inside?

A collection of Verilog modules and their testbenches created as part of my learning in digital system design. Includes:

- Logic gates and multiplexers  
- Adders, subtractors, and simple ALUs  
- Sequential blocks like registers and counters  
- An 8-bit array multiplier (structural + behavioral)  
- Fully automated testbenches

## 🚀 How to simulate (using Vivado)

1. Open **Vivado** (tested with Vivado 2024.1)
2. Create or open a Vivado project
3. Add the Verilog design files and their corresponding testbenches
4. Set the testbench file as the **Top Module**
5. Run **Behavioral Simulation**
6. View waveforms directly in the Vivado Simulator

> ⚠️ Designs may not be portable to Icarus Verilog due to tool-specific features or Xilinx primitives.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Vivado (XSIM)** – for simulation and synthesis  
- **GTKWave** (optional) – if `.vcd` output is generated  
- **VS Code** – for writing and organizing code
